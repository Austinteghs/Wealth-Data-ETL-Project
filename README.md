# Wealth-Data-ETL-Project
Project Overview
This project is a Data Engineering task designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) wealth-related data into a SQLite3 database. The project includes creating a database, defining the necessary tables, loading CSV data into the database, and viewing the results using ipython-sql.

## Technologies Used
### Python: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and database operations.
### SQLite3: The database management system used to store the data.
### Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
### iPython-SQL: An extension for IPython notebooks to allow SQL queries directly from the notebook environment.

## Project Structure
### Database Creation: A SQLite3 database named account.db is created to store the wealth data.
### Table Creation: Three tables (accountscountry, accountsdata, accountseries) are created to store data on wealth-related information.
### Data Loading: Data from three CSV files is loaded into the respective tables.
### Data Viewing: The data is viewed using ipython-sql directly within a Jupyter Notebook.
